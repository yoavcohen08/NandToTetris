# NandToTetris
Nand to Tetris Projects Overview
Nand to Tetris is a computer science course that teaches how to build a computer system from scratch, 
starting with simple logic gates and culminating in a full software stack and operating system. 
Below is a brief description of each project:

**Project 1: Boolean Logic**
**Description:** Built basic Boolean logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) using only a NAND gate. These gates form the foundation of all subsequent hardware.
**Key Components:** AND, OR, XOR, MUX, DMUX, NOT.

**Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic**
**Description:** Constructed basic arithmetic operations, including addition and subtraction, culminating in a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
**Key Components:** Half Adder, Full Adder, 16-bit ALU.

**Project 3: Sequential Logic**
**Description:** Designed memory components that store data, including flip-flops, registers, and RAM modules.
**Key Components:** DFF, Register, RAM (8, 64, 512, 4K, 16K).

**Project 4: Machine Language Programming**
**Description:** Developed assembly programs for the Hack platform, including simple operations and loops. Gained hands-on experience with low-level programming.
**Key Programs:** Add, Max, Rect, Pong (simple games or utility programs).

**Project 5: Computer Architecture**
**Description:** Combined sequential and combinational logic to build the Hack CPU, completing the architecture of the Hack computer system.
**Key Components:** CPU, Memory, Program Counter (PC).

**Project 6: Assembler**
**Description:** Built an assembler to translate Hack assembly language into machine code, bridging the gap between high-level programming and hardware.
**Key Concepts:** Parsing, symbol resolution, binary code generation.

**Project 7: Virtual Machine I (Stack Arithmetic)**
**Description:** Implemented the first part of a virtual machine translator to handle stack-based arithmetic and logical operations.
**Key Features:** Push, Pop, Add, Sub, Neg, Eq, Gt, Lt, And, Or, Not.

**Project 8: Virtual Machine II (Program Flow and Function Calls)**
**Description:** Extended the virtual machine to support program flow and function calls, including labels, conditional jumps, and call/return functionality.
**Key Features:** Labels, Goto, If-Goto, Functions, Return.

**Project 9: High-Level Language Implementation**
**Description:** Wrote programs in the Jack high-level language to test the software stack, including object-oriented design principles.
**Key Programs:** Pong, other interactive programs.

**Project 10: Compiler I (Syntax Analysis)**
**Description:** Built a syntax analyzer for the Jack programming language, producing structured representations (parse trees) of Jack code.
**Key Components:** Tokenizer, Parser.

**Project 11: Compiler II (Code Generation)**
**Description:** Extended the compiler to generate VM code from Jack programs, bridging the gap between high-level programming and virtual machine operations.
**Key Features:** Object handling, variable scoping, code generation.

**Project 12: Operating System**
**Description:** Developed the Jack OS, implementing essential services such as memory management, string handling, input/output, and more.
