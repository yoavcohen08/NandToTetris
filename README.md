# Nand to Tetris Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Nand to Tetris** GitHub repository! This repository contains all my projects from the [Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course, where we build a computer from the ground up, starting with basic logic gates and culminating in a complete virtual machine and operating system.

## üìö Course Overview

The Nand to Tetris course is a hands-on journey through the foundations of computer science and computer engineering. It includes the following key milestones:

1. Building elementary logic gates (NAND, OR, AND, etc.).
2. Constructing an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
3. Developing a simple CPU and assembling a working computer architecture.
4. Writing a custom assembly language and compiler.
5. Building a virtual machine translator.
6. Developing a simple operating system.
7. Creating high-level programs and games to run on the platform.
